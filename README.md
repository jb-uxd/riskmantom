#Our EthDenver 2022 Journey

We arrived from this Linkedin post calling on UX Designers: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshuadoner_uxdesigners-ux-activity-6899151435607740416-gt15?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web

Based on our research, along with the Linkedin post contents and the information on https://www.ethdenver.com/bounties/tracer, we concluded that the MR LONG MRS SHORT PRIZE was a 'Design Bounty'. Considering the first bounty states, "Build out a CREATIVE INTERFACE that simplifies the process of buying a short or long token." and the second bounty, PERPETUAL POOLS - STRUCTURED PRODUCT PRIZE states, "Build a STRUCTURED PRODUCT that connects Perpetual Pools with other protocols for users to earn yield." 

We are still grateful for the experience, and hope to be involved next year, however, it would be a massive shame to be excluded from entry due to confusion surrounding the process of being a remote virtual participant. 

Much love from down under.
